# Shell Provider

The _Shell_ provider allows you to execute arbitrary shell scripts and parse their JSON output for use in your _Terraform_ configurations. This is particularly useful for running scripts that interact with external APIs, or other systems that don't have a native _Terraform_ provider, or for performing complex data transformations.

## Features

This provider offers the following features.

- Configurable platform specific scripting environment
- Strongly typed input variables
- Strongly typed output value
- Access to current state in scripts
- Custom error details
- Script logging

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "shell" {}

data "shell_script" "example" {
  environment = {
    MY_ENV_VAR = "my-value"
  }

  inputs = {
    target = "my-resource"
  }

  os_commands = {
    default = {
      read = {
        command = file("${path.module}/scripts/read.sh")
      }
    }
    windows = {
      read = {
        command = file("${path.module}/scripts/read.ps1")
      }
    }
  }
}

resource "shell_script" "example" {
  environment = {
    MY_ENV_VAR = "my-value"
  }

  inputs = {
    target = "my-resource"
  }

  os_commands = {
    default = {
      create = {
        command = file("${path.module}/scripts/create.sh")
      }
      read = {
        command = file("${path.module}/scripts/read.sh")
      }
      update = {
        command = file("${path.module}/scripts/update.sh")
      }
      delete = {
        command = file("${path.module}/scripts/delete.sh")
      }
    }
    windows = {
      create = {
        command = file("${path.module}/scripts/create.ps1")
      }
      read = {
        command = file("${path.module}/scripts/read.ps1")
      }
      update = {
        command = file("${path.module}/scripts/update.ps1")
      }
      delete = {
        command = file("${path.module}/scripts/delete.ps1")
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `environment` (Map of String) The environment variables to set when executing scripts.
- `log_output` (Boolean) If `true`, lines output by the script will be logged at the appropriate level if they start with the `[<LEVEL>]` pattern where `<LEVEL>` can be one of `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG` & `TRACE`.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) Timeout for resource creation; defaults to `10m`. This should be a string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as `30s` or `2h45m`. Valid time units are `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours).
- `delete` (String) Timeout for resource deletion; defaults to `10m`. This should be a string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as `30s` or `2h45m`. Valid time units are `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours).
- `read` (String) Timeout for resource or data source reads; defaults to `10m`. This should be a string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as `30s` or `2h45m`. Valid time units are `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours).
- `update` (String) Timeout for resource update; defaults to `10m`. This should be a string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as `30s` or `2h45m`. Valid time units are `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours).
