# Shell Provider

The _Shell_ provider allows you to execute arbitrary shell scripts and parse their JSON output for use in your _Terraform_ configurations. This is particularly useful for running scripts that interact with external APIs, or other systems that don't have a native _Terraform_ provider, or for performing complex data transformations.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "shell" {
  interpreter = ["/bin/bash", "-c"]
}

data "shell_script" "example" {
  environment = {
    "TARGET" = "my-resource"
  }

  command = file("${path.module}/scripts/read.sh")
}

resource "shell_script" "example" {
  environment = {
    "TARGET" = "my-resource"
  }

  commands = {
    create = file("${path.module}/scripts/create.sh")
    read   = file("${path.module}/scripts/read.sh")
    update = file("${path.module}/scripts/update.sh")
    delete = file("${path.module}/scripts/delete.sh")
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `environment` (Map of String) The environment variables to set when executing scripts.
- `interpreter` (List of String) The interpreter to use for executing scripts if not provided by the resource or data source. This defaults to `["/bin/bash", "-c"]` or `["pwsh", "-c"]` on Windows.
- `log_output` (Boolean) If `true`, lines output by the script will be logged at the appropriate level if they start with the `[<LEVEL>]` pattern where `<LEVEL>` can be one of `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG` & `TRACE`.
